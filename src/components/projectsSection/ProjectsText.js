          As a fresher, I have worked on a range of web development projects, 
        from building responsive websites to developing full-stack applications and complex front-end interfaces.
        These projects have allowed me to hone my skills in both front-end and back-end development, 
        with a focus on creating clean, user-friendly, and efficient solutions.
